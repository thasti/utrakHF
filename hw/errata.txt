# uTrakHF PCB Errata
  * MOSFET pinout is wrong - impact: gates of GPS/Si5351 enable are swapped
    * currently fixed in software (pin swap)
  * PGND (pin 18) of SPV1050 is not connected to GND
    * solder bridge between pin 19 and 20 can be extended to pin 18
  * enabling GPS and/or Si5351 takes excessive inrush current
    * needs series resistors, 10 R and 5 R has been proven to be working
  * MPPT can not supply sufficient charging current using two solar cells in series.
    * fixed by add-on-board with SPV1040 + 3.3V regulator
